This application was a part of my self-interest. The logo in this application was made using Adobe Photoshop. 

- Splash Activity extends AwesomeSplash Activity. 

- GoogleSignInAccount button is used for Sign in to any Google account making it easier for people to verify using Google Authentication. 

- This application is connected to my Firebase account for storing data into realtime database. So if anyone wants to use this application he/she needs to change the token key used to connect to a Firebase. 

- If you're facing any issue connecting to Firebase it must be due to tokens used. Change it if you want to keep your data as private. 

- User can log in using multiple accounts. Since many of us have multiple google accounts, I considered the idea of using multiple account for a particular user.

- This application can be extended widely by considering Parking Systems, Transportation Systems, etc that is near by a particular location. Since Google charge for multiple location access I didn't extend the application.
